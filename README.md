# Knight-run
This is a Java game project built using Maven. The objective of the game is for the player to navigate a maze to collect a certain number of rewards. After the player has collected all the rewards, they can navigate all the way to the end of the maze to finish the game.

#Getting Started
To run the game, you'll need to have Maven installed on your machine. You can install Maven by following the instructions on the official Maven website.

Once you have Maven installed, you can run the game by following these steps:

1) Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
2) Navigate to the project directory using cd java-maze-game.
3) Build the project using Maven by running mvn package.
4) Run the game using java -jar target/java-maze-game-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.

#Dependencies
The game project relies on the following libraries:

java.awt
javax.swing
java.awt.event
These libraries are included in the project's pom.xml file and will be downloaded and installed automatically by Maven when you build the project.

#Usage
Once the game is running, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the player through the maze. The player must collect all of the rewards before they can reach the end of the maze to finish the game. The game window will display the player's score and the number of rewards remaining.
